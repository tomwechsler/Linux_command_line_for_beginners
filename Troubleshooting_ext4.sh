lsblk

dump2fs /dev/sde2 | grep uperblock #(everything is ok with /dev/sde2 - I write "uperblock" because I don't know if it's upper or lower case)

dump2fs /dev/sdb2 | grep uperblock

fsck /dev/sdb2 #(We could try to repair the partition directly => BUT, we are looking for the superblocks)

mkfs.ext4 -n /dev/sdb2 #(ATTENTION: be sure to use -n!!!!) => now we see the superblocks

fsck -b 40961 /dev/sdb2 #(after -b insert a superblock from above)

fsck /dev/sdb2
